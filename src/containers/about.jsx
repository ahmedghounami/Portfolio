          Student at 1337 School, <br></br> future Full Stack Developer
          <br></br>
        </p>
        <p className="font-extralight">
          I started my programming journey with the 1337 piscine,<br></br> a
          month-long immersion that was both challenging <br></br>and rewarding.
          It was during this time that I gained <br></br> invaluable knowledge,
          which set the foundation for my future<br></br> as a developer. After
          being selected as a student at 1337,<br></br> I continued to push
          myself through more complex challenges,<br></br> gaining over a year
          of experience. I am constantly evolving,<br></br> building projects,
          and growing in the tech field, always eager to face the next
          challenge.
